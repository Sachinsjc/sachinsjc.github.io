Hello, my name is Chauhan Sachin and I am a second-year pursuing Mechanical Engineering at Gujarat Technological University. 👉 I have good command over 2D and 3D CAD designing software tools along with decent knowledge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), thermal engineering, and thermo-fluid computer simulations. 👉 Contact me for Website-Design & Development, AutoCAD & SolidWorks like: 👉 3D Modeling services are essential for advanced engineering projects. · Solid modeling. · Surface modeling. · Assembly modeling. 2D Drafting Transfer your design into a professional CAD format. · Validation of 2D design data. · Component/assembly drawings. · Customer presentations. · Tooling/manufacture drawings. 2D to 3D Conversion of Design Data A large data of either manually made drawings, or computerized 2D data exists. Several of these organizations are now transitioning towards 3D modeling on CAD with a variety of applications. A major task for this organization is to convert the 2D data to 3D so that it can be used directly or after modification on the 3D CAD Software, We offer services for such 2D to 3D Conversion of Design Data. Design & Detail Engineering of components · Die, Jigs & Fixture design. · Press tool design. · Process Equipment Design. Analysis of Components · Finite Element Analysis. · Structural & Stress Analysis. · CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Analysis. · Mechanical Design.
